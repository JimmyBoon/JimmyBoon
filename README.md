<h1> Hello! </h1>

Hi, my name is James. I started studying web and game development in 2015, learning from online tutorials and working on personal projects. In 2021 I decided to leave my career in aviation operations and commit to the world of IT.

Currently I am studying a computer science degree full time at Queensland University of Technology.
